.SH NAME
PyGopherd \- Multiprotocol Information Server
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpygopherd\fR [ \fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Welcome to \fBPyGopherd\fR\&.  In a nutshell, \fBPyGopherd\fR
is a modern dynamic
multi-protocol hierarchical information server with a pluggable
modularized extension system, 
full flexible caching, virtual files and
folders, and autodetection of file types -- all with support for
standardized yet extensible per-document metadata. Whew! Read on for
information on this what all these buzzwords mean.
.SH "QUICK START"
.PP
If you have already installed \fBPyGopherd\fR system-wide, or your
administrator has done that for you, your task for setting up
\fBPyGopherd\fR for the first time is quite simple.  You just need
to set up your configuration file, make your folder directory,
and run it!
.PP
You can quickly set up your configuration file.  The
distribution includes two files of interest:
\fIconf/pygopherd.conf\fR and
\fIconf/mime.types\fR\&.  Debian users will find
the configuration file pre-installed in
\fI/etc/pygopherd/pygopherd.conf\fR and the
\fImime.types\fR file provided by the system
already.
.PP
Open up \fIpygopherd.conf\fR in your editor and
adjust to suit.  The file is heavily commented and you can
refer to it for detailed information.  Some settings to take a
look at include: \fIdetach\fR,
\fIpidfile\fR, \fIport\fR, 
\fIusechroot\fR, \fIsetuid\fR,
\fIsetgid\fR, and \fIroot\fR\&.
These may or may not work at their defaults for you.  The
remaining ones should be fine for a basic setup.
.PP
Invoke \fBPyGopherd\fR with \fBpygopherd
path/to/configfile\fR (or
\fB/etc/init.d/pygopherd start\fR on Debian).
Place some files in the location specified by the
\fIroot\fR directive in the config file and
you're ready to run!
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All \fBPyGopherd\fR configuratoin is done via the configuration
file.  Therefore, the program has only one command-line
option:
.TP
\fB\fIconfigfile\fB\fR
This option argument specifies the location
of the configuration file that \fBPyGopherd\fR is to use.
